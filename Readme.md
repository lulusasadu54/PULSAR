Hello there, my name is Timmy ðŸ‘‹
I am a passionate developer who loves computer science, graphic design, and more globally to learn and create new things.

I created several mods on a few sandbox games, some of these mods are for sale, but I spent most of my time on these games working for communities as a freelancer.
